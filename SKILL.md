name: stylistic-devices
description: Transform dry technical writing into engaging, memorable prose using stylistic devices. Use when asked to make technical content more accessible, engaging, or memorable. Triggers include requests to "make this more engaging", "add style", "make it memorable", "humanize", "simplify technical writing", or explicit mentions of similes, metaphors, allusions, or alliteration.

# Stylistic Devices for Technical Writing
 
Transform technical content into engaging prose using four core devices: similes, metaphors, allusions, and alliteration.
 
## Core Devices
 
### Simile
Compare technical concepts to familiar things using "like" or "as".
 
**Pattern**: "[Technical concept] is like [familiar thing]. Just as [familiar behavior], [technical behavior]."
 
**Example**:
- Before: "MCP establishes a client-server topology as an abstraction layer."
- After: "MCP is like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI to external systems."
 
### Metaphor
Direct comparison without "like" or "as"—the technical thing *becomes* the familiar thing.
 
**Pattern**: "[Technical thing] becomes a [familiar thing], [action that metaphor enables]."
 
**Example**:
- Before: "The MCP server interfaces with Notion's block-based data model and handles recursive serialization."
- After: "Your MCP server becomes a tour guide through the tangle, translating Notion's complex structure into something the AI can navigate."
 
### Allusion
Reference well-known stories, movies, or cultural touchstones.
 
**Pattern**: Reference a scene or concept your audience knows, then connect it to the technical behavior.
 
**Example**:
- Before: "The server exposes tool definitions—JSON schemas defining available operations."
- After: "The server delivers a 'Forrest Gump' box of chocolates—a menu of methods showing what's possible. In this case, though, you know exactly what you'll get."
 
### Alliteration
Repeat initial consonant sounds for emphasis and memorability.
 
**Pattern**: Use sparingly for key phrases, typically 2-4 words.
 
**Examples**: "plug-and-play possibilities", "consistent and clear communication", "speedy and seamless sync"
 
## Enhancement Techniques
 
Beyond the four core devices, use these to strengthen connection:
 
| Technique | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| "You" / "We" | Centers the reader in the action | "Your MCP server..." vs "The MCP server..." |
| Present tense | Creates urgency | "The system processes..." vs "The system will process..." |
| Wake words | Triggers attention | "Imagine...", "What if...", "Think about this..." |
| Native language | Matches audience vocabulary | Use leadership terms for executives, technical terms for developers |
 
## Workflow
 
1. **Identify the technical concept** needing clarification
2. **Choose your device**:
   - Simile: When explaining what something *does*
   - Metaphor: When explaining what something *is*
   - Allusion: When the audience shares cultural references
   - Alliteration: For memorable taglines or key phrases
3. **Match the comparison to the audience** (USB for developers, kitchen appliances for general audiences, etc.)
4. **Apply enhancement techniques** (you/we, present tense, wake words)
5. **Verify the comparison is accurate**—don't sacrifice precision for style
